## Overview

This is my current portfolio webpage. I am designing this site as I learn during my time 
at Lambda School. My goal is to include many, if not all, of the concepts I am learning 
in the development of this site.

## My process

The design process was done in browser and is ongoing as I learn
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

As of the creation of this readME file, the biggest takeaway is to avoid designing in browser at all cost.
Wireframing saves time.
